# Machine Learning for Dummies

This repository contains all the source code accompanying
the equivalent article series on Medium.


## Part 1

The first article explains the basics of Neural Networks,
Genetic Programming, Evolution, Competitive Systems and
NEAT.

**Examples**

- [Flappy Plane Demo](https://github.com/cookiengineer/talks/tree/master/demo/flappy-plane)


## Part 2

The second article explains the inner architecture of
Neural Networks and implements an example Feed Forward NN
to demonstrate how neurons connect and interact.

## Part 3

TBD: This article will cover Backpropagation and explain
the Reinforcement Learning idea to modify neuron weights.


## Part 4

TBD: This article will explain ANNs in detail and how to
properly generate, analyze and innovate them using genetic
programming.


## Part 5

TBD: This article will cover NEAT in particular and compare
it to other evolutionary concepts.


## Part 6

TBD: This article will cover Backpropagated NEAT in particular
and compare it to other reinforcement learning concepts.
